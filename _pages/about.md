Hello! I'm a 40-something man/husband/dad balancing life and dodging stuff between Zürich (Switzerland) and Berlin (Germany).

# Work

I have been developing software for over 20 years, and I still love to code.

I currently work for [UBS](https://ubs.com) in Switzerland, where my team designs and implements the Compliance/KYC system for the bank.
We make sure bad guys don't end up doing business with UBS.

As consultant, I have worked in large financial institutions, telecomunications companies and start-ups all over Europe. Take a look at my [Linkedin profile](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/ishipsoftware) for a detailed list of previous engagments and technology stacks.

For 3 years, I have run my own consulting company, where we went from 0 clients to several, large accounts in less than a year and we enjoyed a steady growth. During my 3 years at [Aestas](http://aestasit.com/), I wore several hats, including software architect,
developer, trainer, conference speaker and business developer.

I'm a [published](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/groovy-2-cookbook) writer.
